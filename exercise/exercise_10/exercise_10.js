/**
Exercise 10: Higher-Order Functions and Callbacks

Problem:

Implement a higher-order function `processArray` that takes an array and 
a callback function. 

The function should apply the callback to each element of the array and 
return a new array with the results. 

Use this function to square each element in an array of numbers.
